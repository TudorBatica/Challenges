## Getting started

### Prerequisites 

Building this project requires [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  

### Run locally

First, restore the dependencies: `flutter pub get`.  
1. Run in `debug mode`: `flutter run`  
Affects the app's performance and size, but enables features like assertions and hot reload.  
2. Run in  `release mode`: `flutter run --release`     

*Note: This is a project meant only for the web, so building for any other platform will most likely fail or the app will not run properly.*
